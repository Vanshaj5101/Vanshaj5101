### 🎯 What I do

- I build & maintain data pipelines, automations & ETL workflows to turn messy or scattered data into reliable, actionable insights.  
- I create reporting dashboards & visualizations (Tableau, Looker Studio, Power BI etc.) to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.  
- I love writing clean SQL, efficient Python code, designing data models, and optimizing for performance and maintainability.  
- I’m exploring frontend dev so I can bridge backend / analytics & the end user experience more tightly.
